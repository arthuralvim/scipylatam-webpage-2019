description: Abstract --------  In this talk I will present the packages "invlin" and "coseismic", which I implemented in Python, making intensive use of Scipy and Numpy for numerical computation. The "invlin" package is dedicated to solve linear inverse problems, which is useful in many scientific contexts. I will show some usage examples and results. The package "coseismic" depends on "invlin" and uses it for the estimation of the slip distribution of earthquakes using GNSS coordinates as input. I will show the results obtained for earthquakes that occurred during the past decade.  Methodology -----------  In several fields of science and engineering we face inverse problems: we want to infer little known or unknown parameters from observations and a predictive model. The "invlin" package contains functions that tackle this task for linear inverse problems, for example using a probabilistic approach (Tarantola and Valette [1], Tarantola [2]). The numerical computations call functions of the scipy.linalg and scipy.optimize modules, and operates on numpy.ndarray objects. In the case of "coseismic", the observations are GNSS coordinates of stations, and the parameters are quantities describing an earthquake. The predictive model is based on linear elasticity (Okada [3])  Results -------  The "coseismic" package, and therefore also "invlin", has been used to make reports at the Centro Sismológico Nacional of Universidad de Chile, for instance for the April 2017 earthquake near Valparaiso (see link [i]). It was also used in several scientific papers (see link [ii]) in journals of Seismology and Earth Sciences, in a MSc in Geophysics thesis at Universidad de Chile, and in postgraduate courses at the same University.  Note about GNSS ----------------  Global Navigation Satelite Systems (GNSS) allow to obtain the absolute position of a receptor with a precision of a few centimeters in real time and a few millimeters after several days. These results have had a profound effect on Geodesy and have many applications in science and technology, for example in the characterization of the movement of tectonic plates, to monitor vehicles and whole transport systems, crop harvesting, etc.  Bibliography ------------  [1]  Tarantola, A. and Valette, B., Inverse Problems = Quest for Information, Journal of Geophysics, 50 (1982), pp. 159–170.

summary: I will present the packages "invlin" and "coseismic", which I implemented in Python. The "invlin" package is dedicated to solve linear inverse problems and makes intensive use of Scipy and Numpy. The package "coseismic" depends on "invlin" and uses it to study earthquakes using GNSS data.
