      <h1>CODE OF CONDUCT</h1>
      <p>
        Scipy Latam is a community conference intended for networking and
        collaboration in the developer community. We value the participation of
        each member of the Python community and want all attendees to have an
        enjoyable and fulfilling experience. Accordingly, all attendees are
        expected to show respect and courtesy to other attendees throughout the
        conference and at all conference events, whether officially sponsored by
        the Python Software Foundation or not. To make clear what is expected,
        all staff, attendees, speakers, exhibitors, organizers, and volunteers
        at any Scipy Latam event are required to conform to the following Code
        of Conduct. Organizers will enforce this code throughout the event.
      </p>
      <h2>Our Standards</h2>
      <p>
        Scipy Latam is dedicated to providing a positive conference experience
        for everyone, regardless of age, gender identity and expression, sexual
        orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, ethnicity,
        nationality, race, or religion (or lack thereof), education, or
        socio-economic status. Examples of behavior that contributes to creating
        a positive environment include:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><p>Being kind to others</p></li>
        <li><p>Behaving professionally</p></li>
        <li><p>Using welcoming and inclusive language</p></li>
        <li><p>Being respectful of differing viewpoints and experiences</p></li>
        <li><p>Gracefully accepting constructive criticism</p></li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Participants asked to stop any inappropriate behavior are expected to
        comply immediately. If a participant engages in behavior that violates
        this code of conduct, the conference organizers may take any action they
        deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the
        conference with no refund. Thank you for helping make this a welcoming,
        friendly event for all.
      </p>
      <h2>Weapons Policy</h2>
      <p>
        No weapons are allowed at conference venues, including but not limited
        to explosives (including fireworks), guns, and large knives such as
        those used for hunting or display, as well as any other item used for
        the purpose of causing injury or harm to others. Anyone seen in
        possession of one of these items will be asked to leave immediately, and
        will only be allowed to return without the weapon. Attendees are further
        expected to comply with all state and local laws on this matter.
      </p>
      <h2>Scope</h2>
      <p>
        All Scipy Latam attendees are subject to the Code of Conduct. This
        includes Scipy Latam staff and volunteers, as well as attendees of the
        tutorials, workshops, summits, poster sessions, receptions, conference,
        sprints, and sponsored or unofficial events. Exhibitors in the expo
        hall, sponsor or vendor booths, or similar activities are also subject
        to the Code of Conduct. In particular, exhibitors should not use
